# KanbanBoard
Kanban Board application created mainly with ASP.NET CORE MVC and Entity Framework for database connection.
## Scope
This project was created for the sole purpose of creating a Trello clone-like app using ASP.NET
## Details 
This web application allows you to create personal boards. Within each board, you can add any quantity of columns and cards you want.

Create your board by providing its name in the **Create Board** form. Then add columns using the **Create Column** form, which you may sort using **jQuery's sortable** function. After that click on the **Add Card** button to activate the pop-up window for card description. Each card can be sorted within all columns, allowing an easy organization of your board.

## Tech Stack
This application was made using: 
* ASP.NET CORE MVC
* Entity Framework 
* jQuery
* Javascript
* CSS

## Future of application
Currently, I am working on saving positions of moved columns and cards to a database.
